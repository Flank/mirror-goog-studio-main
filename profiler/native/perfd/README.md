To run perfd on an Android device...

1. Build `perfd` using steps in `.../tools/base/profiler/native/README.md`
1. If successful, binary lives in `.../bazel-bin/tools/base/profiler/native/android/(arch)/`
1. Build and run Android Studio. It will automatically deploy the dev version of the
   perfd binary.
