     * The bypass feature is meant to avoid computing the supplier too early.
     * Gradle will call any annotated getter returning File or Collection&lt;File&gt; during task
     * graph creation. This is because File instances could implement
     * {@link org.gradle.api.Buildable} which contains task dependency information.
     * The bypass allows to return an empty list during task graph creation and to only run the
     * supplier during up-to-date checks when we know the task is going to run. This only works
     * if the the Files do not implement Buildable which is most of the time.
     *
     * The new supplier will also memoize the content, allowing the original supplier to only
     * compute its content once (usually during up-to-date checks), while other uses (in the task
     * action itself) can access the cache.
