/**
 * Class for tracking the number of active Virtual Managed Devices being spawned
 * by the Android Plugin for gradle.
 *
 * This class does not create managed devices, but instead acts as the source of truth
 * for how many concurrent gradle managed devices are being run. Keeping the number capped
 * at [maxGMDs]. The way to request a number of managed devices is with the [lock] method.
 *
 * Example:
 *     val lockManager = VirtualManagedDeviceLockManager(locations, 3)
 *
 *     lockManager.lock(locksRequested).use { lock ->
 *         val locksAcquired = lock.lockCount
 *         // Do stuff with a number of devices equal to the locks acquired...
 *     }
