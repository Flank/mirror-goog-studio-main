/**
 * A [MutableSet] that can be sealed to prevent further updates.
 *
 * It can behave two different ways:
 * - It can wrap another existing collection, providing a sealable view on that collection to
 *   specific clients. Use [SealableSet.wrap] to create such an instance.
 *
 * - It can act as a self contained collection with its own internal storage using a
 *   [LinkedHashSet].
 *   To save on memory in the DSL, the backing collection can be null until items are actually
 *   added. Use [SealableSet.new] to create such an instance.
 *
 * In both cases, all methods returning sub collections, or iterators will return sealable versions
 * of this classes. Sealing the main collection will seal all the sub-items.
