/**
 * Simple task to do a single file copy.
 *
 * Using the built-in Copy task to copy a single file is dangerous if multiple files
 * go in the same folder. This is because Copy uses a folder destination rather than a file
 * destination, and if 2+ Copy task write in the same folder, it'll disable task-level
 * parallelism.
 * Also, when a task output (in this case the folder) is clobbered by another task (which would
 * simply write in the same folder), on the next run the tasks will run again in a non
 * incremental way which is bad.
 *
 * So this task is very simple file to file copy which does not have all these issues, and allow
 * to copy multiple files into the same folder.
