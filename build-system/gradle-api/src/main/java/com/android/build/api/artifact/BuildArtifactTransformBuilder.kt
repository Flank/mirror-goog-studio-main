/**
 * Builder to create a task for a specific variant that consumes or transforms a build artifact.
 *
 * The builder allows the task's input and output to be configured.  This modifies the
 * [InputArtifactProvider], and [OutputFileProvider] that will be constructed of for the [create]
 * method.  The [create] method accept [ConfigurationAction] that will be used to configure the
 * task. This action will not run synchronously but will be invoked later when the DSL objects are
 * sealed and the Android Plugin is creating all tasks from these final values.
 *
 * For example, to create a task that uses compile classpath and javac output and create additional
 * .class files for both compile classpath and javac output:
 *
 * Simple case :
 *
 *  * buildArtifactTransformBuilder
 *     .append(BuildableArtifactType.JAVAC_CLASSES)
 *     .create() { task, input, output ->
 *         task.javaClasses = input.getArtifact(BuildableArtifactType.JAVAC_CLASSES)
 *         task.outputDir = output.getFile()
 *
 * More elaborate case :
 *
 * buildArtifactTransformBuilder
 *     .input(BuildableArtifactType.JAVA_RES)
 *     .append(BuildableArtifactType.JAVAC_CLASSES)
 *     .replace(BuildableArtifactType.JAVA_COMPILE_CLASSPATH)
 *     .create() { task, input, output ->
 *         task.javaRes = input.getArtifact(BuildableArtifactType.JAVA_RES)
 *         task.classpath = input.getArtifact(BuildableArtifactType.JAVA_COMPILE_CLASSPATH)
 *         task.javaClasses = input.getArtifact(BuildableArtifactType.JAVAC_CLASSES)
 *         task.outputDir = output.getFile("classes",
 *             BuildableArtifactType.JAVAC_CLASSES,
 *             BuildableArtifactType.JAVA_COMPILE_CLASSPATH)
 *     }
