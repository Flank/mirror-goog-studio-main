    /**
     * Specifies the ProGuard configuration files that the plugin should use.
     *
     * There are two ProGuard rules files that ship with the Android plugin and are used by
     * default:
     *
     * *    `proguard-android.txt`
     * *    `proguard-android-optimize.txt`
     *
     * The following sample uses a ProGuard rules file to enable code shrinking for the release
     * build type:
     *
     * ```
     * android {
     *     buildTypes {
     *         release {
     *             minifyEnabled true
     *             proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt')
     *         }
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * When you build your project, the plugin creates a copy of the settings file in
     * `project-root/build/intermediates/proguard-files/`. For even more code shrinking, try the
     * `proguard-android-optimize.txt` file located in the same directory. It includes the same
     * default ProGuard rules, but with other optimizations that perform analysis at the bytecode
     * level—inside and across methods—to reduce your APK size further and help it run faster.
     *
     * To add ProGuard rules that are specific to each build variant, add another `proguardFiles`
     * property in the corresponding [productFlavor][com.android.build.api.dsl.model.ProductFlavor]
     * block. For example, the following Gradle file adds `flavor2-rules.pro` to the flavor2 product
     * flavor. Now flavor2 uses both ProGuard rules files because those from the release block are
     * also applied.
     *
     * ```
     * android {
     *     buildTypes {
     *         release {...}
     *     }
     *     productFlavors {
     *         flavor1 {}
     *         flavor2 {
     *             proguardFile 'flavor2-rules.pro'
     *         }
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *

     * [Shrink Your Code and Resources](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html).
