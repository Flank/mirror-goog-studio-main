/**
 * Utility class to test concurrency.
 *
 * <p>This class is used to check whether or not a set of runnables violate a concurrency contract
 * (e.g., whether they run concurrently when they are not allowed to, or vice versa).
 *
 * <p>The following is a usage scenario of this class. Suppose we have a method that accepts an
 * "action" (of type {@link Runnable} or the like) as an argument (e.g., {@code methodUnderTest(...,
 * actionUnderTest)}) and at some point during the method's execution, the method will invoke the
 * action exactly once. When several threads are concurrently calling the method (possibly with
 * different parameter values), the method may make a contract that all the threads can execute the
 * corresponding actions concurrently, or it may make a contract that all the threads cannot execute
 * the actions concurrently. To check whether the method meets the concurrency contract, we can
 * write a test as follows.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * ConcurrencyTester tester = new ConcurrencyTester();
 * for (...) {
 *     IOExceptionFunction actionUnderTest = (input) -> { ... };
 *     tester.addMethodInvocationFromNewThread(
 *             (IOExceptionFunction anActionUnderTest) -> {
 *                 // ConcurrencyTester requires using anActionUnderTest instead of actionUnderTest
 *                 // when calling methodUnderTest
 *                 methodUnderTest(..., anActionUnderTest);
 *             },
 *             actionUnderTest);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Then, if the actions are allowed to run concurrently, we can make the following assertion:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * tester.assertThatActionsCanRunConcurrently();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>If the actions are not allowed to run concurrently, we can make the following assertion:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * tester.assertThatActionsCannotRunConcurrently();
 * }</pre>
