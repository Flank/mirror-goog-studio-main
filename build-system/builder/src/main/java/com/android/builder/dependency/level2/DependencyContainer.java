/**
 * An immutable representation of the dependencies of a variant.
 *
 * It contains both the graph of dependencies, as {@link DependencyNode} instances, and the flat
 * (and sometimes filtered) representation of the dependencies, as {@link Dependency} instances.
 *
 * If the container represents the PACKAGE scope, then skipped packages have been removed from
 * the flat representations, this is to avoid having to filter them manually all the time.
 *
 * For the COMPILE scope, provided elements are still present in the flat representations since
 * they are actually needed.
 *
 * The graph is untouched with provided/skipped elements still present.
 *
 * Each dependency can be queried from {@link #isProvided(Dependency)} and
 * {@link #isSkipped(Dependency)}. This is queried on {@link Dependency} rather than the nodes,
 * because the information is for all usage of a given dependency, no matter how many time
 * it shows up in the graph.
