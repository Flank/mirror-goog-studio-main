     * <p>The compile method has the following contract:
     * <ul>
     *  <li>Compiling is requested on a file-by-file basis, {@code file} is the file to compile.
     *  <li>Each compilation request has a specific output directory, {@code output}, that is
     *  guaranteed to exist.
     *  <li>Invoking compile is issuing a request for compilation: the file provided may not be
     *  compilable by {@code aapt}.
     *  <li>The returned promise -- {@code Future} -- will be set to the file with the result of
     *  compilation or {@code null} if the file is not compilable.
     *  <li>If a file is returned, it is located inside the output directory.
     *  <li>Compilation is time-insensitive and isolated with respect to the inputs. This means
     *  that a file is always compiled to the same output (path and content) regardless of when it
     *  is compiled and regardless of which files were compiled before or after.
     *  <li>No two compilable input files generate the same output file.
     *  <li>No other files are written to the output directory other than the returned file.
     *  Subdirectories to contain the returned file may be created by the compile method.
     *  <li>If the input file is not compilable and, therefore, {@code null} is returned, then no
     *  files are changed in the filesystem.
     *  <li>The return promise is only fulfilled when the file is fully written and closed.
     *  <li>The compile method will fulfill the promise as fast as possible.
     *  <li>There is no logical limit on the number of parallel invocations of the compilation
     *  method.
     *  <li>The compile method makes no assumptions on the contents of the output directory.
     *  <li>The compile method can overwrite an existing file in output when compiling.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The method receives the file to compile and returns a promise to return a {@code File}.
     * The compile method issues a "request for compilation": the file passed may not be compilable
     * in which case the future response is it set to {@code null}.
     *
     * @param file the file to compile, must exist and be a file
     * @param output the output directory, must exist and be a directory
     * @return the promise of the compilation result; the future will be set to {@code null} if
     * the file is not compilable
     * @throws AaptException failed to process the compilation request; actual compilation errors,
     * if any, are reported in the returned {@code Future} as they are asynchronous
