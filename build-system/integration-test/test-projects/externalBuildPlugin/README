The structure of this project is not common. It's testing an external build system
integration but taking the application intermediary states and packaging them
together for instant-run.

Structure :
  - jars/                   contains all binary jar file that contains .class and java resources.
  - apk_manifest            example manifest file
  (for reference only, one will be created by the test).
  - resources.ap_           resources for the APK.
  - AndroidManifest.xml     merged manifest file.
