<!--
This is an empty baseline file, used by modules that don't have any preexisting Lint issues.

It exists, because providing a baseline is how Bazel targets opt into running Lint on their
source code.

Please don't add anything here. If your change introduces a Lint warning, suppress it with
@Suppress (in Koltin) or @SuppressWarnings (in Java) and include a comment explaining why
Lint was wrong. Please also consider fixing Lint if you see false positives.
