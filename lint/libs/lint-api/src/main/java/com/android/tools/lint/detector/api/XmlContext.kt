     * just used for error highlighting, but also for features such
     * as quickfixes, where it's Very Very Badâ„¢ to have the range
     * magically change to some subset.
     * <p>
     * This method instead creates error ranges intended for warning
     * display purposes. If [node] is non null, the location for that
     * node will be used. Otherwise, if [attribute] is provided it will
     * highlight the given attribute range if the attribute is
     * specified. A common example of this is the "name" attribute
     * in resource values. If not passed in or not defined on the
     * element, this method will use the element range if it fits
     * on a single line; otherwise it will use just the tag name
     * range.
