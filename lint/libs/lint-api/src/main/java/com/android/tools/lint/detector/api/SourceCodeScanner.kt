/**
 * Interface to be implemented by lint detectors that want to analyze
 * Java source files (or other similar source files, such as Kotlin files.)
 * <p>
 * There are several different common patterns for detecting issues:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Checking calls to a given method. For this see
 * {@link #getApplicableMethodNames()} and
 * {@link #visitMethodCall(JavaContext, UCallExpression, PsiMethod)}</li>
 * <li> Instantiating a given class. For this, see
 * {@link #getApplicableConstructorTypes()} and
 * {@link #visitConstructor(JavaContext, UCallExpression, PsiMethod)}</li>
 * <li> Referencing a given constant. For this, see
 * {@link #getApplicableReferenceNames()} and
 * {@link #visitReference(JavaContext, UReferenceExpression, PsiElement)}</li>
 * <li> Extending a given class or implementing a given interface.
 * For this, see {@link #applicableSuperClasses()} and
 * {@link #visitClass(JavaContext, UClass)}</li>
 * <li> More complicated scenarios: perform a general AST
 * traversal with a visitor. In this case, first tell lint which
 * AST node types you're interested in with the
 * {@link #getApplicableUastTypes()} method, and then provide a
 * {@link UElementHandler} from the {@link #createUastHandler(JavaContext)}
 * where you override the various applicable handler methods. This is
 * done rather than a general visitor from the root node to avoid
 * having to have every single lint detector (there are hundreds) do a full
 * tree traversal on its own.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * {@linkplain SourceCodeScanner} exposes the UAST API to lint checks.
 * UAST is short for "Universal AST" and is an abstract syntax tree library
 * which abstracts away details about Java versus Kotlin versus other similar languages
 * and lets the client of the library access the AST in a unified way.
 * <p>
 * UAST isn't actually a full replacement for PSI; it <b>augments</b> PSI.
 * Essentially, UAST is used for the <b>inside</b> of methods (e.g. method bodies),
 * and things like field initializers. PSI continues to be used at the outer
 * level: for packages, classes, and methods (declarations and signatures).
 * There are also wrappers around some of these for convenience.
 * <p>
 * The {@linkplain SourceCodeScanner} interface reflects this fact. For example,
 * when you indicate that you want to check calls to a method named {@code foo},
 * the call site node is a UAST node (in this case, {@link UCallExpression},
 * but the called method itself is a {@link PsiMethod}, since that method
 * might be anywhere (including in a library that we don't have source for,
 * so UAST doesn't make sense.)
 * <p>
 * <h2>Migrating JavaPsiScanner to SourceCodeScanner</h2>
 * As described above, PSI is still used, so a lot of code will remain the
 * same. For example, all resolve methods, including those in UAST, will
 * continue to return PsiElement, not necessarily a UElement. For example,
 * if you resolve a method call or field reference, you'll get a
 * {@link PsiMethod} or {@link PsiField} back.
 * <p>
 * However, the visitor methods have all changed, generally to change
 * to UAST types. For example, the signature
 * {@link JavaPsiScanner#visitMethodCall(JavaContext, JavaElementVisitor, PsiMethodCallExpression, PsiMethod)}
 * should be changed to {@link SourceCodeScanner#visitMethodCall(JavaContext, UCallExpression, PsiMethod)}.
 * <p>
 * Similarly, replace {@link JavaPsiScanner#createPsiVisitor} with {@link SourceCodeScanner#createUastHandler},
 * {@link JavaPsiScanner#getApplicablePsiTypes()} with {@link SourceCodeScanner#getApplicableUastTypes()}, etc.
 * <p>
 * There are a bunch of new methods on classes like {@link JavaContext} which lets
 * you pass in a {@link UElement} to match the existing {@link PsiElement} methods.
 * <p>
 * If you have code which does something specific with PSI classes,
 * the following mapping table in alphabetical order might be helpful, since it lists the
 * corresponding UAST classes.

 * </table>
 * Note however that UAST isn't just a "renaming of classes"; there are
 * some changes to the structure of the AST as well. Particularly around
 * calls.
 *
 * <h3>Parents</h3>
 * In UAST, you get your parent {@linkplain UElement} by calling
 * {@code getUastParent} instead of {@code getParent}. This is to avoid
 * method name clashes on some elements which are both UAST elements
 * and PSI elements at the same time - such as {@link UMethod}.
 * <h3>Children</h3>
 * When you're going in the opposite direction (e.g. you have a {@linkplain PsiMethod}
 * and you want to look at its content, you should <b>not</b> use
 * {@link PsiMethod#getBody()}. This will only give you the PSI child content,
 * which won't work for example when dealing with Kotlin methods.
 * Normally lint passes you the {@linkplain UMethod} which you should be procesing
 * instead. But if for some reason you need to look up the UAST method
 * body from a {@linkplain PsiMethod}, use this:
 * <pre>
 *     UastContext context = UastUtils.getUastContext(element);
 *     UExpression body = context.getMethodBody(method);
 * </pre>
 * Similarly if you have a {@link PsiField} and you want to look up its field
 * initializer, use this:
 * <pre>
 *     UastContext context = UastUtils.getUastContext(element);
 *     UExpression initializer = context.getInitializerBody(field);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Call names</h3>
 * In PSI, a call was represented by a PsiCallExpression, and to get to things
 * like the method called or to the operand/qualifier, you'd first need to get
 * the "method expression". In UAST there is no method expression and this
 * information is available directly on the {@linkplain UCallExpression} element.
 * Therefore, here's how you'd change the code:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;    call.getMethodExpression().getReferenceName();
 * ---
 * &gt;    call.getMethodName()
 * </pre>
 * <h3>Call qualifiers</h3>
 * Similarly,
 * <pre>
 * &lt;    call.getMethodExpression().getQualifierExpression();
 * ---
 * &gt;    call.getReceiver()
 * </pre>
 * <h3>Call arguments</h3>
 * PSI had a separate PsiArgumentList element you had to look up before you could
 * get to the actual arguments, as an array. In UAST these are available directly on
 * the call, and are represented as a list instead of an array.
 * <pre>
 * &lt;    PsiExpression[] args = call.getArgumentList().getExpressions();
 * ---
 * &gt;    List<UExpression> args = call.getValueArguments();
 * </pre>
 * Typically you also need to go through your code and replace array access,
 * arg\[i], with list access, {@code arg.get(i)}. Or in Kotlin, just arg\[i]...
 *
 * <h3>Instanceof</h3>
 * You may have code which does something like "parent instanceof PsiAssignmentExpression"
 * to see if something is an assignment. Instead, use one of the many utilities
 * in {@link UastExpressionUtils} - such as {@link UastExpressionUtils#isAssignment(UElement)}.
 * Take a look at all the methods there now - there are methods for checking whether
 * a call is a constructor, whether an expression is an array initializer, etc etc.
 *
 * <h3>Android Resources</h3>
 * Don't do your own AST lookup to figure out if something is a reference to
 * an Android resource (e.g. see if the class refers to an inner class of a class
 * named "R" etc.)  There is now a new utility class which handles this:
 * {@link ResourceReference}. Here's an example of code which has a {@link UExpression}
 * and wants to know it's referencing a R.styleable resource:
 * <pre>
 *        ResourceReference reference = ResourceReference.get(expression);
 *        if (reference == null || reference.getType() != ResourceType.STYLEABLE) {
 *            return;
 *        }
 *        ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Binary Expressions</h3>
 * If you had been using {@link PsiBinaryExpression} for things like checking comparator
 * operators or arithmetic combination of operands, you can replace this with
 * {@link UBinaryExpression}. <b>But you normally shouldn't; you should use
 * {@link UPolyadicExpression} instead</b>. A polyadic expression is just like a binary
 * expression, but possibly with more than two terms. With the old parser backend,
 * an expression like "A + B + C" would be represented by nested binary expressions
 * (first A + B, then a parent element which combined that binary expression with C).
 * However, this will now be provided as a {@link UPolyadicExpression} instead. And
 * the binary case is handled trivially without the need to special case it.
 * <h3>Method name changes</h3>
 * The following table maps some common method names and what their corresponding
 * names are in UAST.
 * <table>
 *     <caption>Mapping between PSI and UAST method names</caption></caption>
 *     <tr><th>PSI</th><th>UAST</th></tr>
 *     <tr><td>getArgumentList</td><td>getValueArguments</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>getCatchSections</td><td>getCatchClauses</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>getDeclaredElements</td><td>getDeclarations</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>getElseBranch</td><td>getElseExpression</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>getInitializer</td><td>getUastInitializer</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>getLExpression</td><td>getLeftOperand</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>getOperationTokenType</td><td>getOperator</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>getOwner</td><td>getUastParent</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>getParent</td><td>getUastParent</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>getRExpression</td><td>getRightOperand</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>getReturnValue</td><td>getReturnExpression</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>getText</td><td>asSourceString</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>getThenBranch</td><td>getThenExpression</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>getType</td><td>getExpressionType</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>getTypeParameters</td><td>getTypeArguments</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>resolveMethod</td><td>resolve</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * <h3>Handlers versus visitors</h3>
 * If you are processing a method on your own, or even a full class, you should switch
 * from JavaRecursiveElementVisitor to AbstractUastVisitor.
 * However, most lint checks don't do their own full AST traversal; they instead
 * participate in a shared traversal of the tree, registering element types they're
 * interested with using {@link #getApplicableUastTypes()} and then providing
 * a visitor where they implement the corresponding visit methods. However, from
 * these visitors you should <b>not</b> be calling super.visitX. To remove this
 * whole confusion, lint now provides a separate class, {@link UElementHandler}.
 * For the shared traversal, just provide this handler instead and implement the
 * appropriate visit methods. It will throw an error if you register element types
 * in {@linkplain #getApplicableUastTypes()} that you don't override.
 *
 * <p>
 * <h3>Migrating JavaScanner to SourceCodeScanner</h3>
 * First read the javadoc on how to convert from the older {@linkplain JavaScanner}
 * interface over to {@linkplain JavaPsiScanner}. While {@linkplain JavaPsiScanner} is itself
 * deprecated, it's a lot closer to {@link SourceCodeScanner} so a lot of the same concepts
 * apply; then follow the above section.
 * <p>
