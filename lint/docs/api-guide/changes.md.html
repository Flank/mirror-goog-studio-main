**Recent Changes**

This chapter lists recent changes to lint that affect lint check
authors: new features, API and behavior changes, and so on. For
information about user visible changes to lint, see
[](../usage/changes.md.html).

**7.0**

* The API level has bumped to 10.

* Partial analysis. Lint's architecture has changed to support better
  scalability across large projects, where module results can be
  cached, etc. See the api-guide's dedicated chapter for more details.
  To opt in before it's turned on by default to test this on your full
  Gradle projects rather than just the detector tests, add

      `android.experimental.useLintPartialAnalysis=true`

  to your `gradle.properties` file. If you want to debug your lint check
  you may want to also set

      `android.experimental.runLintInProcess=true`

* Issue registration now takes an optional `Vendor` property, where you
  can specify information about which company or team provided this
  lint check, which library it's associated with, contact information,
  and so on. This will make it easier for users to figure out where to
  send feedback or requests for 3rd party lint checks.

* Bytecode verification: Instead of warning about 3rd party lint checks
  being obsolete because they were not compiled against the latest Lint
  API, lint now run its own bytecode verification against the lint jar
  and will silently accept accept older (and newer!) lint checks if
  they do not reference APIs that are not available.

* Android Lint checks can now always access the resource repository for
  random access to resources, instead of having to gather them in batch
  mode. (Previously this was only available when lint checks were
  running in the IDE.)

* The lint unit testing library now provides a `TestMode` concept. You
  can define setup and teardown methods, and lint will run unit tests
  repeatedly for each test mode. There are a number of built-in test
  modes already enabled; for example, all lint tests will run both in
  global analysis mode and in partial analysis mode, and the results
  compared to ensure they are the same.

* Lint unit tests now include source contents for secondary locations
  too. If the test fails, lint will retry without secondary source
  locations and not report an error; this preserves backwards
  compatibility.

* There's a new `Incident` class which is used to hold information to
  be reported to the user. Previously, there were a number of
  overloaded methods to report issues, taking locations, error
  messages, quick fixes, and so on. Each time we added another one we'd
  have to add another overload. Now, you instead just report incidents.
  This is critical to the new partial analysis architecture but is also
  required if you for example want to override severities per incident
  as described above.

* Lint checks can now vary the severity on a per incident basis by
  calling overrideSeverity on the incidents. This means that there is
  no longer a need to create separate issues for flavors of the same
  underlying problem with slightly different expectations around
  warnings or errors.

* There are additional modifier lookup methods for Kotlin modifiers
  on `JavaEvaluator, like isReified(), isCompanion(), isTailRec(), and
  so on.

* API documentation is now available.
