# Annotations

Annotations allow API authors to express constraints that tools can
enforce. There are many examples of these, along with existing lint
checks:

* `@VisibleForTesting`: this API is considered private, and has been
   exposed only for unit testing purposes
* `@CheckResult`: anyone calling this method is expected to do
  something with the return value
* `@CallSuper`: anyone overriding this method must also invoke `super`
* `@UiThread`: anyone calling this method must be calling from the UI thread
* `@Size`: the size of the annotated array or collection must be
    of a particular size
* `@IntRange`: the annotated integer must have a value in the given range

...and so on. Lint has built-in checks to enforce these, along with
infrastructure to make them easy to write, and to share analysis such
that improvements to one helps them all. This means that you can easily
write your own annotations-based checks as well.

!!! Tip
   Note that the annotation support helps you write checks where you
   check *usages* of annotated elements, not usages of the annotations
   themselves. If you simply want to look at actual annotations,
   override `getApplicableUastTypes` to return
   `listOf(UAnnotation::class.java)`, and override `createUastHandler`
   to return an `object : UElementHandler` which simply overrides
   `visitAnnotation`.

## Basics

To create a basic annotation checker, there are two required steps:

1. Register the fully qualified name (or names) of the annotation
   classes you want to analyze, and
2. Implement the `visitAnnotationUsage` callback for handling each
   occurrence.

Here's a basic example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
override fun applicableAnnotations(): List<String> {
    return listOf("my.pkg.MyAnnotation")
}

override fun visitAnnotationUsage(
    context: JavaContext,
    element: UElement,
    annotationInfo: AnnotationInfo,
    usageInfo: AnnotationUsageInfo
) {
    val name = annotationInfo.qualifiedName.substringAfterLast('.')
    val message = "`${usageInfo.type.name}` usage associated with " +
                  "`@$name` on ${annotationInfo.origin}"
    val location = context.getLocation(element)
    context.report(TEST_ISSUE, element, location, message)
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All this simple detector does is flag any usage associated with the
given annotation, including some information about the usage.

If we for example have the following annotated API:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
annotation class MyAnnotation
abstract class Book {
    operator fun contains(@MyAnnotation word: String): Boolean = TODO()
    fun length(): Int = TODO()
    @MyAnnotation fun close() = TODO()
}
operator fun Book.get(@MyAnnotation index: Int): Int = TODO()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

...and we then run the above detector on the following test case:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
fun test(book: Book) {
    val found = "lint" in book
    val firstWord = book[0]
    book.close()
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

we get the following output:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~text
src/book.kt:14: Error: METHOD_CALL_PARAMETER usage associated with @MyAnnotation on PARAMETER
    val found = "lint" in book
                 ----
src/book.kt:15: Error: METHOD_CALL_PARAMETER usage associated with @MyAnnotation on PARAMETER
    val firstWord = book[0]
                         -
src/book.kt:16: Error: METHOD_CALL usage associated with @MyAnnotation on METHOD
    book.close()
         -------
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the first case, the infix operator “in” will call `contains` under
the hood, and here we've annotated the parameter, so lint visits the
argument corresponding to that parameter (the literal string “lint”).

The second case shows a similar situation where the array syntax will
end up calling our extension method, `get()`.

And the third case shows the most common scenario: a straight forward
method call to an annotated method.

In many cases, the above detector implementation is nearly all you have
to do to enforce an annotation constraint. For example, in the
`@CheckResult` detector, we want to make sure that anyone calling a
method annotated with `@CheckResult` will not ignore the method return
value. All the lint check has to do is register an interest in
*`androidx.annotation.CheckResult`*, and lint will invoke
`visitAnnotationUsage` for each method call to the annotated method.
Then we just check the method call to make sure that its return value
isn't ignored, e.g. that it's stored into a variable or passed into
another method call.

## Annotation Usage Types and isApplicableAnnotationUsage

### Method Override

In the detector above, we're including the “usage type” in the error
message. The usage type tells you something about how the annotation is
associated with the usage element -- and in the above, the first two
cases have a usage type of “parameter” because the visited element
corresponds to a parameter annotation, and the third one a method
annotation.

There are many other usage types. For example, if we add the following
to the API:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
open class Paperback : Book() {
    override fun close() { }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

then the detector will emit the following incident since the new method
overrides another method that was annotated:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~text
src/book.kt:14: Error: METHOD_OVERRIDE usage associated with @MyAnnotation on METHOD
    override fun close() { }
                 -----
1 errors, 0 warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overriding an annotated element is how the `@CallSuper` detector is
implemented, which makes sure that any method which overrides a method
annotated with `@CallSuper` is invoking `super` on the overridden
method somewhere in the method body.

### Method Return

Here's another example, where we have annotated the return value
with @MyAnnotation:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
open class Paperback : Book() {
    fun getDefaultCaption(): String = TODO()
    @MyAnnotation
    fun getCaption(imageId: Int): String {
        if (imageId == 5) {
            return "Blah blah blah"
        } else {
            return getDefaultCaption()
        }
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here, lint will flag the various exit points from the method
associated with the annotation:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~text
src/book.kt:18: Error: METHOD_RETURN usage associated with @MyAnnotation on METHOD
            return "Blah blah blah"
                    --------------
src/book.kt:20: Error: METHOD_RETURN usage associated with @MyAnnotation on METHOD
            return getDefaultCaption()
                   -------------------
2 errors, 0 warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note also that this would have worked if the annotation had been
inherited from a super method instead of being explicitly set here.

One usage of this mechanism in Lint is the enforcement of return values
in methods. For example, if a method has been marked with
`@DrawableRes`, Lint will make sure that the returned value of that
method will not be of an incompatible resource type (such as
`@StringRes`).

### Handling Usage Types

As you can see, your callback will be invoked for a wide variety of
usage types, and sometimes, they don't apply to the scenario that your
detector is interested in. Consider the `@CheckResult` detector again,
which makes sure that any calls to a given method will look at the
return value. From the “method override” section above, you can see
that lint would *also* notify your detector for any method that is
*overriding* (rather than calling) a method annotated with
`@CheckResult`. We don't want to report those.

There are two ways to handle this. The first one is to check whether
the usage element is a `UMethod`, which it will be in the overriding
case, and return early in that case.

The recommended approach, which `CheckResultDetector` uses, is to
override the `isApplicableAnnotationUsage` method:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
override fun isApplicableAnnotationUsage(type: AnnotationUsageType): Boolean {
    return type != AnnotationUsageType.METHOD_OVERRIDE &&
            super.isApplicableAnnotationUsage(type)
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! Tip
   Notice how we are also calling `super` here and combining the result
   instead of just using a hardcoded list of expected usage types. This
   is because, as discussed below, lint already filters out some usage
   types by default in the super implementation.

### Usage Types Filtered By Default

The default implementation of `Detector.isApplicableAnnotationUsage`
looks like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
open fun isApplicableAnnotationUsage(type: AnnotationUsageType): Boolean {
    return type != AnnotationUsageType.BINARY &&
           type != AnnotationUsageType.EQUALITY
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These usage types apply to cases where annotated elements are
compared for equality or using other binary operators. Initially
introducing this support led to a lot of noise and false positives;
most of the existing lint checks do not want this, so they're opt-in.

An example of a lint check which *does* enforce this is the
`@HalfFloat` lint check. In Android, a
[HalfFloat](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/annotation/
 HalfFloat) is a representation of a floating point value (with less
precision than a `float`) which is stored in a `short`, normally an
integer primitive value. If you annotate a `short` with `@HalfFloat`,
including in APIs, lint can help catch cases where you are making
mistakes -- such as accidentally widening the value to an int, and so
on. Here are some example error messages from lint's unit tests for the
half float check:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~text
src/test/pkg/HalfFloatTest.java:23: Error: Expected a half float here, not a resource id [HalfFloat]
        method1(getDimension1()); // ERROR
                ---------------
src/test/pkg/HalfFloatTest.java:43: Error: Half-float type in expression widened to int [HalfFloat]
        int result3 = float1 + 1; // error: widening
                      ------
src/test/pkg/HalfFloatTest.java:50: Error: Half-float type in expression widened to int [HalfFloat]
        Math.round(float1); // Error: should use Half.round
                   ------
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Scopes

Many annotations apply not just to methods or fields but to classes and
even packages, with the idea that the annotation applies to everything
within the package.

For example, if we have this annotated API:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin linenumbers
annotation class ThreadSafe
annotation class NotThreadSafe

@ThreadSafe
abstract class Stack<T> {
    abstract fun size(): Int
    abstract fun push(item: T)
    abstract fun pop(): String
    @NotThreadSafe fun save() { }

    @NotThreadSafe
    abstract class FileStack<T> : Stack<T>() {
        abstract override fun pop(): String
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And the following test case:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin linenumbers
fun test(stack: Stack<String>, fileStack: Stack<String>) {
    stack.push("Hello")
    stack.pop()
    fileStack.push("Hello")
    fileStack.pop()
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here, `stack.push` call on line 2 resolves to the API method on line 7.
That method is not annotated, but it's inside a class that is annotated
with `@ThreadSafe`. Similarly for the `pop()` call on line 3.

The `fileStack.push` call on line 4 also resolves to the same method
as the call on line 2 (even though the concrete type is a `FileStack`
instead of a `Stack), so like on line 2, this call is taken to be
thread safe.

However, the `fileStack.pop` call on line 6 resolves to the API method
on line 14. That method is not annotated, but it's inside a class
annotated with `@NotThreadSafe`, which in turn is inside an outer class
annotated with `@ThreadSafe`. The intent here is clearly that that
method should be considered not thread safe.

To help with scenarios like this, lint will provide *all* the
annotations (well, all annotations that any lint checks have registered
interest in via `getApplicableAnnotations`; it will not include
annotations like `java.lang.SuppressWarnings` and so on unless a lint
check asks for it).

This is provided in the `AnnotationUsageInfo` passed to the
`visitAnnotationUsage` parameters. The `annotations` list will include
all relevant annotations, **in scope order**. That means that for the
above `pop` call on line 5, it will point to first the annotations on
the `pop` method (and here there are none), then the `@NotThreadSafe`
annotation on the surrounding class, and then the `@ThreadSafe`
annotation on the outer class, and then annotations on the file itself
and the package.

The `index` points to the annotation we're analyzing. If for example
our detector had registered an interest in `@ThreadSafe`, it would be
called for the second `pop` call as well, since it calls a method
inside a `@ThreadSafe` annotation (on the outer class), but the `index`
would be 1. The lint check can check all the annotations earlier than
the one at the index to see if they "counteract" the annotation, which
of course the `@NotThreadSafe` annotation does.

Lint uses this mechanism for example for the `@CheckResult` annotation,
since some APIs are annotated with `@CheckResult` for whole packages
(as an API convention), and then there are explicit exceptions carved
out using `@CanIgnoreReturnValue`. There is a method on the
`AnnotationUsageInfo`, `anyCloser`, which makes this check easy:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
if (usageInfo.anyCloser { it.qualifiedName ==
     "com.google.errorprone.annotations.CanIgnoreReturnValue" }) {
    // There's a closer @CanIgnoreReturnValue which cancels the
    // outer @CheckReturnValue annotation we're analyzing here
    return
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! Tip
   You only have to worry about this when there are different
   annotations that interact with each other. If the same annotation is
   found in multiple nested contexts, lint *will* include all the
   annotations in the `AnnotationUsageInfo`, but it will not invoke
   your callback for any outer occurrences; only the closest one. This
   is usually what detectors expect: the innermost one "overrides" the
   outer ones, so lint omits these to help avoid false positives where
   a lint check author forgot to handle and test this scenario. A good
   example of this situation is with the `@RequiresApi` annotation; a
   class may be annotated as requiring a particular API level, but a
   specific inner class or method within the class can have a more
   specific `@RequiresApi` annotation, and we only want the detector to
   be invoked for the innermost one. If for some reason your detector
   *does need* to handle all of the repeated outer occurrences, note
   that they're all there in the `annotations` list for the
   `AnnotationUsageInfo` so you can look for them and handle them when
   you are invoked for the innermost one.

### Inherited Annotations

As we saw in the method overrides section, lint will include
annotations in the hierarchy: annotations specified not just on a
specific method but super implementations and so on.

This is normally what you want -- for example, if a method is annotated
with `@CheckResult` (such as `String.trim()`, where it's important to
understand that you're not changing the string in place, there's a new
string returned so it's probably a mistake to not use it), you probably
want any overriding implementations to have the same semantics.

However, there are exceptions to this. For example,
`@VisibleForTesting`. Perhaps a super class made a method public only
for testing purposes, but you have a concrete subclass where you are
deliberately supporting the operation, not just from tests. If
annotations were always inherited, you would have to create some sort
of annotation to "revert" the semantics, e.g.
`@VisibleNotJustForTesting`, which would require a lot of noisy
annotations.

Lint lets you specify the inheritance behavior of individual
annotations. For example, the lint check which enforces the
`@VisibleForTesting` and `@RestrictTo` annotations handles it like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
override fun inheritAnnotation(annotation: String): Boolean {
    // Require restriction annotations to be annotated everywhere
    return false
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Note that the API passes in the fully qualified name of the annotation
in question so you can control this behavior individually for each
annotation when your detector applies to multiple annotations.)
