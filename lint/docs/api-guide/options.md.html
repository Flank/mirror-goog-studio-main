# Options

## Usage

Users can configure lint using `lint.xml` files, turning on and off
checks, changing the default severity, ignoring violations based on
paths or regular expressions matching paths or messages, and so on.

They can also configure “options” on a per issue type basis. Options
are simply strings, booleans, integers or paths that configure how a
detector works.

For example, in the following `lint.xml` file, we're configuring the
`UnknownNullness` detector to turn on its `ignoreDeprecated` option,
and we're telling the `TooManyViews` detector that the maximum number
of views in a layout it should allow before generating a warning should
be set to 20:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~xml
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;lint&gt;
    &lt;issue id="UnknownNullness"&gt;
        &lt;option name="ignoreDeprecated" value="true" /&gt;
    &lt;/issue&gt;
    &lt;issue id="TooManyViews"&gt;
        &lt;option name="maxCount" value="20" /&gt;
    &lt;/issue&gt;
&lt;/lint&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that `lint.xml` files can be located not just in the project
directory but nested as well, for example for a particular source
folder.

(See the [lint.xml](../usage/lintxml.md.html) documentation for more.)

## Creating Options

First, create an `Option` and register it with the corresponding
`Issue`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
val MAX_COUNT = IntOption("maxCount", "Max number of views allowed", 80)
val MY_ISSUE = Issue.create("MyId", ...)
        .setOptions(listOf(MAX_COUNT))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An option has a few pieces of metadata:

* The name, which is a short identifier. Users will configure the
  option by listing this key along with the configured value in their
  `lint.xml` files. By convention this should be using camel case and
  only valid Java identifier characters.

* A description. This should be a short sentence which lists the
  purpose of the option (and should be capitalized, and not end with
  punctuation).

* A default value. This is the value that will be returned from
  `Option.getValue()` if the user has not configured the setting.

* For integer and float options, minimum and maximum allowed values.

* An optional explanation. This is a longer explanation of the option,
  if necessary.

The name and default value are used by lint when options are looked up
by detectors; the description, explanation and allowed ranges are used
to include information about available options when lint generates for
example HTML reports, or text reports including explanations, or
displaying lint checks in the IDE settings panel, and so on.

There are currently 5 types of options: Strings, booleans, ints, floats
and paths. There's a separate option class for each one, which makes it
easier to look up these options since for example for a `StringOption`,
`getValue` returns a `String`, for an `IntOption` it returns an `Int`,
and so on.

Option Type             | Option Class
------------------------|-----------------------------------
`String`                | `StringOption`
`Boolean`               | `BooleanOption`
`Int`                   | `IntOption`
`Float`                 | `FloatOption`
`File`                  | `FileOption`

## Reading Options

To look up the configured value for an option, just call `getValue`
and pass in the `context`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
val maxCount = MAX_COUNT.getValue(context)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will return the `Int` value configured for this option by the
user, or if not set, our original default value, in this case 80.

## Specific Configurations

The above call will look up the option configured for the specific
source file in the current `context`, which might be an individual
Kotlin source file. That's generally what you want; users can configure
`lint.xml` files not just at the root of the project; they can be
placed throughout the source folders and are interpreted by lint to
apply to the folders below. Therefore, if we're analyzing a particular
Kotlin file and we want to check an option, you generally want to check
what's configured locally for this file.

However, there are cases where you want to look up options up front,
for example at the project level.

In that case, first look up the particular configuration you want, and
then pass in that configuration instead of the context to the
`Option.getValue` call.

For example, the context for the current module is already available in
the `context`, so you might for example look up the option value like
this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
val maxCount = MAX_COUNT.getValue(context.configuration)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Files

Note that there is a special `Option` type for files and paths:
`FileOption`. Make sure that you use this instead of just a
`StringOption` if you are planning on configuring files, because in the
case of paths, users will want to specify paths relative to the
location of the `lint.xml` file where the path is defined. For
`FileOption` lint is aware of this and will convert the path string as
necessary.
