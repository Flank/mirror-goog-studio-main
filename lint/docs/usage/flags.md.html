# Lint Command Lint Flags

Usage: `lint` *flags*

When using lint from within Gradle, see the [Lint Gradle Plugin
DSL](agp-dsl.md.html) options instead.

## General

`--help`
: This message.

`--help` *topic*
: Help on the given topic, such as “suppress”.

`--list`
: List the available issue id's and exit.

`--version`
: Output version information and exit.

`--exitcode`
: Set the exit code to 1 if errors are found.

`--show`
: List available issues along with full explanations.

`--show` *ids*
: Show full explanations for the given list of issue id's.

`--generate-docs`
: Generates documentation for all the lint checks. This flag cannot be
  combined with other lint flags, and it has its own sub-flags. Invoke
  on its own to see what they are.

`--fatalOnly`
: Only check for fatal severity issues

`--apply-suggestions`
: Apply suggestions to the source code (for safe fixes)

`--abort-if-suggestions-applied`
: Set the exit code to an error if any fixes are applied

*directories*
: You can also pass in directories for files to be analyzed. This
  was common many years ago when project metadata tended to be stored
  in simple `.classpath` files from Eclipse; these days, you typically
  will pass it a `--lint-model` or `--project` description instead.

## Enabled Checks

`--disable` *list*
: Disable the list of categories or specific issue id's. The list
  should be a comma-separated list of issue id's or categories.

`--enable` *list*
: Enable the specific list of issues. This checks all the default
  issues plus the specifically enabled issues. The list should be a
  comma-separated list of issue id's or categories.

`--check` *list*
: Only check the specific list of issues. This will disable everything
  and re-enable the given list of issues. The list should be a
  comma-separated list of issue id's or categories.

`--fatal` *list*
: Sets the default severity of the given issue to fatal

`--error` *list*
: Sets the default severity of the given issue to error

`--warning` *list*
: Sets the default severity of the given issue to warning

`--info` *list*
: Sets the default severity of the given issue to info

`-w,` --nowarn
: Only check for errors (ignore warnings)

`-Wall`
: Check all warnings, including those off by default

`-Werror`
: Treat all warnings as errors

`--config` *filename*
: Use the given configuration file to determine whether issues are
  enabled or disabled. If a project contains a lint.xml file, then
  this config file will be used as a fallback.

`--override-config` *filename*
: Like --config, but instead of being a fallback, this configuration
  overrides any local configuration files

`--baseline`
: Use (or create) the given baseline file to filter out known issues.

`--update-baseline`
: Updates the baselines even if they already exist

`--remove-fixed`
: Rewrite the baseline files to remove any issues that have been
  fixed

`--allow-suppress`
: Whether to allow suppressing issues that have been explicitly
  registered as not suppressible.

`--restrict-suppress`
: Opposite of --allow-suppress: do not allow suppressing restricted
  issues

## Output Options

`--quiet`
: Don't show progress.

`--stacktrace`
: Print full stacktrace for internal errors.

`--fullpath`
: Use full paths in the error output.

`--showall`
: Do not truncate long messages, lists of alternate locations, etc.

`--nolines`
: Do not include the source file lines with errors in the output. By
  default, the error output includes snippets of source code on the
  line containing the error, but this flag turns it off.

`--html` *filename*
: Create an HTML report instead. If the filename is a directory (or a
  new filename without an extension), lint will create a separate
  report for each scanned project.

`--url` filepath=url
: Add links to HTML report, replacing local path prefixes with url
  prefix. The mapping can be a comma-separated list of path prefixes
  to corresponding URL prefixes, such as
  C:\temp\Proj1=http://buildserver/sources/temp/Proj1.  To turn off
  linking to files, use --url none

`--xml` *filename*
: Create an XML report instead.

`--sarif` *filename*
: Create a SARIF report instead.

`--text` *filename*
: Write a text report to the given file. If the filename is just
  `stdout` (short for standard out), the report is written to the
  console.

## Project Options

`--resources` *dir*
: Add the given folder (or path) as a resource directory for the
  project. Only valid when running lint on a single project.

`--sources` *dir*
: Add the given folder (or path) as a source directory for the
  project. Only valid when running lint on a single project.

`--classpath` *dir*
: Add the given folder (or jar file, or path) as a class directory for
  the project. Only valid when running lint on a single project.

`--libraries` *dir*
: Add the given folder (or jar file, or path) as a class library for
  the project. Only valid when running lint on a single project.

`--compile-sdk-version` *version*
: Use the given compileSdkVersion to pick an SDK target to resolve
  Android API call to

`--sdk-home` *dir*
: Use the given SDK instead of attempting to find it relative to the
  lint installation or via $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT

`--jdk-home` *dir*
: Use the given JDK instead of attempting to find it via $JAVA_HOME or
  java.home

`--java-language-level` *level*
: Use the given version of the Java programming language

`--kotlin-language-level` *level*
: Use the given version of the Kotlin programming language

## Advanced Options (for build system integration)

`--project` *file*
: Use the given project layout descriptor file to describe the set of
  available sources, resources and libraries. Used to drive lint with
  build systems not natively integrated with lint.

`--lint-model` *path*
: Alternative to --project which defines the project layout

`--variant` *name*
: The name of the variant from the lint model to use for analysis

`--lint-rule-jars` *path*
: One or more .jar files to load additional lint checks from

`--analyze-only`
: Perform only analysis, not reporting, of the given lint model

`--report-only`
: Perform only reporting of previous analysis results

`--path-variables` *variables*
: Path variables to use in internal persistence files to make lint
  results cacheable. Use a semi-colon separated list of name=path
  pairs.

`--describe-suggestions` *file*
: Describes all the quickfixes in an XML file expressed as document
  edits -- insert, replace, delete

`--stacktrace`
: Dump exceptions from detectors to the console

## Exit Status

`0`
: Success.

`1`
: Lint errors detected.

`2`
: Lint usage.

`3`
: Cannot clobber existing file.

`4`
: Lint help.

`5`
