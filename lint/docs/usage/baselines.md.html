# Baselines

# Creating a Baseline

You can take a snapshot of your project's current set of warnings,
and then use the snapshot as a baseline for future inspection runs
so that only new issues are reported. The baseline snapshot lets you
start using lint to fail the build without having to go back and
address all existing issues first.

To create a baseline snapshot, modify your project's `build.gradle```
file as follows.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
android {
  lintOptions {
    baseline file("lint-baseline.xml")
  }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you first add this line, the `lint-baseline.xml` file is
created to establish your baseline. From then on, the tools only
read the file to determine the baseline. If you want to create a new
baseline, manually delete the file and run lint again to recreate it.

Then, run lint from the IDE (**Analyze > Inspect Code**) or from
the command line as follows. The output prints the location of the
lint-baseline.xml file. The file location for your setup might be
different from what is shown here.

```shell
    $ ./gradlew lintDebug
    ...
    Wrote XML report to file:///app/lint-baseline.xml
    Created baseline file /app/lint-baseline.xml
```

Running lint records all of the current issues in the
`lint-baseline.xml` file. The set of current issues is called the
baseline, and you can check the lint-baseline.xml file into version
control if you want to share it with others.

## Customize the baseline

If you want to add some issue types to the baseline, but not all of
them, you can specify the issues to add by editing your project's
build.gradle, as follows.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
android {
  lintOptions {
    check 'NewApi', 'HandlerLeak'
    baseline file("lint-baseline.xml")
  }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you create the baseline, if you add any new warnings to the
codebase, lint lists only the newly introduced bugs.

## Baseline warning

When baselines are in effect, you get an informational warning that
tells you that one or more issues were filtered out because they
were already listed in the baseline. The reason for this warning is
to help you remember that you have configured a baseline, because
ideally, you would want to fix all of the issues at some point.

This informational warning does not only tell you the exact number of
errors and warnings that were filtered out, it also keeps track of
issues that are not reported anymore. This information lets you know
if you have actually fixed issues, so you can optionally re-create
the baseline to prevent the error from coming back undetected.

!!! Note: Baselines are enabled when you run inspections in batch
   mode in the IDE, but they are ignored for the in-editor checks that
   run in the background when you are editing a file. The reason is that
   baselines are intended for the case where a codebase has a massive
   number of existing warnings, but you do want to fix issues locally
   while you touch the code.
