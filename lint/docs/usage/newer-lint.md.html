# Combining AGP With Newer Lint

Lint is integrated with the Android Gradle plugin; when you run lint
from the command line or on your CI server, it will first build all the
necessary artifacts, which involves running various optional Gradle
plugins, and so on.

Updating the Gradle plugin that you're using to build your project is
not always possible:

* For production apps you probably want to limit your builds to using
  the stable version of AGP

* For older projects not in active development that you're only
  building to make small maintenance updates, updating the build files
  may not be worth the effort.

* You may be stuck on an older version temporarily because you're using
  some third party Gradle plugin which is not yet compatible with the
  latest Gradle or AGP versions.

However, lint is in active development, with new checks being added,
existing checks being enhanced and extended, and false positive and
false negative bugs getting fixed. You'll almost always be better off
running the latest version of lint, *including preview versions*.

As of AGP 7.0, it's possible to use a newer version of lint in
conjunction with AGP. The way this works is that you tell AGP which
version of lint you want to run, and when you run the `lint` target, it
will first build all the necessary artifacts using the current version
of AGP and build scripts. Then it will invoke the newer version of
lint, passing in a bunch of state for lints purposes, and the newer
lint will then analyze the code and produce its report.

## Configuring the Lint Version

In `gradle.properties`, add a property declaration like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~properties
android.experimental.lint.version = 7.1.0-beta01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! Warning
   This feature flag is experimental and will change once the flag is
   promoted.

That's all there is to it. Now running `./gradlew :app:lint` will build
the codebase using your AGP version configured in `build.gradle`, such
as 7.0.0, and then the lint analysis and reporting will use version
7.1.0-beta01.

!!! Note
   This will only work with AGP 7.0.0-beta05 later. Note also that
   while running a more recent version is supported, you cannot run an
   older version of lint than AGP. This is usually not what you want
   anyway.

## Updating Lint

Provided the `GradleDependency` issue is enabled, lint will check your
`gradle.properties` file and warn you if there is a newer version of
lint available than the one you're pointing to:

```text
gradle.properties:2: Warning: Newer version of lint available: 7.1.0-alpha04 [GradleDependency]
android.experimental.lint.version = 7.0.0-rc01
                                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
0 errors, 1 warnings
```

There is also a quickfix in the IDE to perform this update.

Normally, the `GradleDependency` warning will only suggest updating to
a newer version that is a preview if the current dependency is a
preview. However, for using the unbundled lint version, lint will
always suggest using previews. If you for some reason want to limit
yourself to stable versions, such as 8.0.0 while still building with
7.0.0, you can suppress the warning like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~properties
#noinspection GradleDependency
android.experimental.lint.version=8.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
