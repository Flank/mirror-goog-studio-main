**Recent Changes**

This chapter lists recent changes to lint that affect users of lint.
For information about internal improvements and API changes affecting
lint check authors, see [](../api-guide/changes.md.html).

**7.0**

* There are a number of new lint checks, particularly to support
  Android 12.

* Lint checks now include information for reported incidents where the
  lint check came from, such as which library artifact provided it.
  This should make it easier to request enhancements or file bugs
  around false positives or false negatives.

* Lint “partial analysis” mode is now integrated in lint, off by
  default, but you can enable it by modifying `gradle.properties`
  to include

      `android.experimental.useLintPartialAnalysis=true`

**4.2**

* Improved support for lint.xml configuration files. You can now
  specify lint.xml files in project source folders, where the settings
  will apply recursively within just that folder. You can also specify
  options for detectors, and enable or disable checks for specific
  clients (such as just in Gradle, or just in the IDE, and so on.)

* Support for SARIF reports; a static analysis report file format
  supported by for example GitHub, allowing the results to be
  visualized in a unified way on CI servers.
