**Recent Changes**

This chapter lists recent changes to lint that affect users of lint.
For information about internal improvements and API changes affecting
lint check authors, see the API Guide.

**7.1**

* New built-in lint checks:

  Issue ID                         | Summary
  ---------------------------------|-----------------------------------
  `FileEndsWithExt`                | Flags suspicious usages of File.endsWith(extension)

* Updated lint checks:

  Issue ID             | Summary
  ---------------------|--------------------------
  `MissingTranslation` | Now checks for missing translations of plurals
  `WrongConstant`      | Now has quickfixes to replace with constants

* The `com.android.application` Gradle plugin now sets
  `checkDependencies` to true by default. This means that when lint
  runs on an app module, the report will include not only the issues
  found in that module but also the issues found in its library
  dependencies. This means that you can run `./gradlew :app:lint` and
  see a single report instead of having to navigate to the individual
  reports for each of the included libraries. It also makes the
  analysis more accurate; for example, unused resources only make
  sense with checkDependencies on, such that lint can consider
  resource declarations and usages across module boundaries.

  With this change, if your project consists of a number of libraries
  and a consuming app module, consider running just
  `./gradle :app:lint` instead of `./gradlew lint`.

**7.0**

* New built-in lint checks:

  Issue ID                         | Summary
  ---------------------------------|-----------------------------------
  `AnnotateVersionCheck`           | Annotate SDK_INT checks
  `CoarseFineLocation`             | Cannot use `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` without `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`
  `CustomSplashScreen`             | Application-defined Launch Screen
  `CustomX509TrustManager`         | Implements custom TLS trust manager
  `HighSamplingRate`               | High sensor sampling rate
  `IntentFilterExportedReceiver`   | Unspecified `android:exported` in manifest
  `LaunchActivityFromNotification` | Notification Launches Services or BroadcastReceivers
  `LeanbackUsesWifi`               | Using android.hardware.wifi on TV
  `MediaCapabilities`              | Media Capabilities property not specified
  `NotificationTrampoline`         | Notification Trampolines
  `NotifyDataSetChanged`           | Invalidating All RecyclerView Data
  `TileProviderPermissions`        | TileProvider does not set permission
  `TrustAllX509TrustManager`       | Insecure TLS/SSL trust manager
  `UnspecifiedImmutableFlag`       | Missing `PendingIntent` mutability flag
  `WatchFaceEditor`                | Watch face editor must use launchMode=“standard”
  `WebViewClientOnReceivedSslError`| Proceeds with the HTTPS connection despite SSL errors

* Lint checks now include information for reported incidents where the
  lint check came from, such as which library artifact provided it.
  This should make it easier to request enhancements or file bugs
  around false positives or false negatives.

* The Gradle plugin now maps the `lint` task to the default variant's
  lint task instead of running it across all variants and accumulating
  results. This is much faster, is usually what you want, and now the
  target name will not change based on whether the project has product
  flavors, so you can start just running `./gradlew :app:lint` instead
  of `./gradlew :app:lintDebug` or `:app:lintProDebug` etc.

* Lint “partial analysis” mode is now integrated in lint. It is
  enabled by default, but you can disable it by modifying
  `gradle.properties` to include

      `android.enableParallelLint=false`

* The API check now also looks up operator overloading functions.

**4.2**

* Improved support for lint.xml configuration files. You can now
  specify lint.xml files in project source folders, where the settings
  will apply recursively within just that folder. You can also specify
  options for detectors, and enable or disable checks for specific
  clients (such as just in Gradle, or just in the IDE, and so on.)

* Support for SARIF reports; a static analysis report file format
  supported by for example GitHub, allowing the results to be
  visualized in a unified way on CI servers.
