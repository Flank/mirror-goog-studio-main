**Recent Changes**

This chapter lists recent changes to lint that affect users of lint.
For information about internal improvements and API changes affecting
lint check authors, see the API Guide.

**7.3**

* New built-in lint-checks:

  Issue ID                 | Summary
  -------------------------|-----------------------------------
  `SuspiciousIndentation`  | Flags suspiciously indented code
  `StringFormatTrivial`    | Avoid trivial conversions in String.format
  `WearableActionDuplicate`| Duplicate watch face configurations

**7.2**

* New built-in lint checks:

  Issue ID                | Summary
  ------------------------|-----------------------------------
  `AssertionSideEffect`   | Assertions that have side effects
  `BidiSpoofing`          | Misleading bidirectional Unicode strings
  `MotionLayoutMissingId` | Views inside MotionLayout require an id
  `UastImplementation`    | Avoid UAST implementation classes

**7.1**

* The various annotation-based checks now perform additional checks for
  overloaded Kotlin operators, as well as additional scenarios where
  the annotation is inherited from outer classes, super methods, and in
  the case of fields, containing classes and packages (this was already
  the case for methods). This may show up as new violations in your
  codebase, such as the `VisibleForTests` check flagging additional
  usages of test-only APIs outside of tests.

* New built-in lint checks:

  Issue ID                | Summary
  ------------------------|-----------------------------------
  `FileEndsWithExt`       | Flags suspicious usages of File.endsWith(extension)
  `DataExtractionRules`   | Missing data extraction rules
  `RedundantLabel`        | Redundant label on activity in manifest
  `DiscouragedApi`        | Using APIs annotated with @Discouraged
  `ViewBindingType`       | Validation for `tools:viewBindingType`
  `AppBundleLocaleChanges`| Handling runtime locale changes

* Updated lint checks:

  Issue ID             | Summary
  ---------------------|--------------------------
  `MissingTranslation` | Now checks for missing translations of plurals
  `WrongConstant`      | Now has quickfixes to replace with constants
  `CheckResult`        | Now also runs in unit tests

* Removed lint check `MediaCapabilities` since its advice is no longer the
  recommended practice.

**7.0**

* New built-in lint checks:

  Issue ID                         | Summary
  ---------------------------------|-----------------------------------
  `AnnotateVersionCheck`           | Annotate SDK_INT checks
  `CoarseFineLocation`             | Cannot use `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` without `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`
  `CustomSplashScreen`             | Application-defined Launch Screen
  `CustomX509TrustManager`         | Implements custom TLS trust manager
  `HighSamplingRate`               | High sensor sampling rate
  `IntentFilterExportedReceiver`   | Unspecified `android:exported` in manifest
  `LaunchActivityFromNotification` | Notification Launches Services or BroadcastReceivers
  `LeanbackUsesWifi`               | Using android.hardware.wifi on TV
  `MediaCapabilities`              | Media Capabilities property not specified
  `NotificationTrampoline`         | Notification Trampolines
  `NotifyDataSetChanged`           | Invalidating All RecyclerView Data
  `TileProviderPermissions`        | TileProvider does not set permission
  `TrustAllX509TrustManager`       | Insecure TLS/SSL trust manager
  `UnspecifiedImmutableFlag`       | Missing `PendingIntent` mutability flag
  `WatchFaceEditor`                | Watch face editor must use launchMode=“standard”
  `WebViewClientOnReceivedSslError`| Proceeds with the HTTPS connection despite SSL errors
  `IntentFilterUniqueDataAttributes` | Data tags should only declare unique attributes

* Lint checks now include information for reported incidents where the
  lint check came from, such as which library artifact provided it.
  This should make it easier to request enhancements or file bugs
  around false positives or false negatives.

* The Gradle plugin now maps the `lint` task to the default variant's
  lint task instead of running it across all variants and accumulating
  results. This is much faster, is usually what you want, and now the
  target name will not change based on whether the project has product
  flavors, so you can start just running `./gradlew :app:lint` instead
  of `./gradlew :app:lintDebug` or `:app:lintProDebug` etc.
  Furthermore, the `lintOptions` block is now just named `lint`
  instead.

* Lint “partial analysis” mode is now integrated in lint.

* The API check now also looks up operator overloading functions.

**4.2**

* Improved support for lint.xml configuration files. You can now
  specify lint.xml files in project source folders, where the settings
  will apply recursively within just that folder. You can also specify
  options for detectors, and enable or disable checks for specific
  clients (such as just in Gradle, or just in the IDE, and so on.)

* Support for SARIF reports; a static analysis report file format
  supported by for example GitHub, allowing the results to be
  visualized in a unified way on CI servers.
