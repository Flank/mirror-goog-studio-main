**Testing Development Builds**

This document describes how to run your development version of lint
against some large projects to look for false positives, false
negatives and other issues after making nontrivial changes.

## Conventions

In the following, `$SRC` refers to your checkout of the lint
development branch, normally `studio-main`, and the lint source code is
found in `$SRC/tools/base/lint/`.

## Testing against AndroidX

To run a development version of lint against the AndroidX tree, first
check out AndroidX into `$ANDROIDX`. For checkout instructions, see
[their
README](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/a
ndroidx-main/README.md).

Then, build lint into AGP:

```ksh
cd $SRC/tools
./gradlew pL
```

(`pL` is short for publishLocal; Gradle allows abbreviations. After
making changes to lint only, you can run just `./gradlew pAGL` which is
quite a bit faster because it skips some targets that have to be built
once but aren't affected by lint-only changes.)

We'll need to know the version number of AGP that was built; as of
this writing it's 7.1.0-dev, but that will change multiple times a year so you can consult the actual version with something like this:

```ksh
$ grep buildVersion $SRC/tools/buildSrc/base/version.properties
buildVersion = 7.1.0-dev
```

We'll need to supply a number of override properties, so it's helpful
to place this into a shell function:

```ksh
runGradleForAndroidX() {
    CUSTOM_REPO=$ADT_SOURCE_TREE/out/repo \
    GRADLE_PLUGIN_VERSION=7.1.0-dev \
    GRADLE_PLUGIN_REPO=$ADT_SOURCE_TREE/out/repo:$ADT_SOURCE_TREE/prebuilts/tools/common/m2/repository \
    $ADT_SOURCE_TREE/tools/gradlew --parallel ${@}
}
alias gwx=runGradleForAndroidX
```

Now you can go to `$ANDROIDX` and run all the lint targets (one for
each library):

```ksh
gwx lint
```

If you want to debug a particular scenario, replace the `--parallel`
flag with `--no-daemon -Dorg.gradle.debug=true`, run the build, and
create a Remote configuration in IntelliJ and use it to attach.

## Testing against Android Platform

Lint is run as part of the Android platform builds, including a number of custom lint checks specific to the platform.

The following will refer to the directory containing the Android
platform source code as `$ANDROID_SRC`.

First, checkout the AOSP platform into `$ANDROID_SRC`:

```ksh
mkdir $ANDROID_SRC && cd $ANDROID_SRC
repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b master
```

Then create a new branch for testing:

```ksh
repo start testing123 .
```

Next, build a development version of lint packaged into a commandline
tools component:

```ksh
cd $SRC/tools/base
export DIST_DIR=/tmp/dist && mkdir -p $DIST_DIR
../buildSrc/servers/build_tools.sh
```

After this step, we'll have `/tmp/dist/commandlinetools_linux.zip`
which we now need to insert into the Android platform, with some tweaks:

```ksh
cd $ANDROID_SRC/prebuilts/cmdline-tools/
git rm -rf tools
unzip $DIST_DIR/commandlinetools_linux.zip
mv cmdline-tools tools
git add tools
```

There is one deliberate change to the tools for platform usage that we need to preserve, so back out any changes to `tools/bin/lint`:

```ksh
cd tools/bin && git reset lint && git restore lint
```

That's it. If you don't have a full Android build environment up and
running (or enough diskspace!) you can upload this to gerrit and have
the presubmit machinery do a test run: git commit, repo upload, and
then mark the CL Presubmit-Ready.

Here's an example of a trial balloon CL:
 [](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/prebuilts/cmdline-tools/+/1769725)

And here's a sample CL of a real lint upgrade which shows some of the
other CLs in the topic that were necessary -- updating baselines etc:

[](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/prebuilts/cmdline-tools/+/1746780)

If you **do** have an Android build environment, which is helpful if
you actually need to debug to figure out why something is going on, run
the following target to check lint:

```ksh
m lint-check
```

As usual you'll want to run `. build/envsetup.sh` and `lunch sdk-eng`
first.

If there's a failure, you can look at `out/error.log` where you'll find
something like this:

```
...
The failing command was run inside an sbox sandbox in temporary directory
out/soong/.temp/sbox/aaa65d9ed8eca15675a35eeb74818d9864690068
The failing command line was:
rm -rf ./out/srcjars && mkdir -p ./out/srcjars && ./tools/out/bin/zipsync -d ./out/srcjars -l ./out/srcjars/list -f "*.java" ./out/.intermediates/packages/modules/Permission/PermissionController/PermissionController/android_common_GooglePermissionController_apex30/gen/proto/proto0.srcjar ./out/.intermediates/packages/modules/Permission/PermissionController/PermissionController/android_common_GooglePermissionController_apex30/gen/android/R.srcjar ./out/.intermediates/packages/modules/Permission/PermissionController/PermissionController/android_common_GooglePermissionController_apex30/kapt/kapt-sources.jar
...truncated...
```

Note that the real lint command is prefixed by a few other commands on
the same line so search forwards through `&&` until you get to the line
which starts with `JAVA_OPTS=` (and lop off the rest after the next
`&&` or '||').

Here's a typical invocation that we're left with:

```
JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx3072m --add-opens java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED"
ANDROID_SDK_HOME=out/soong/.intermediates/packages/modules/Permission/Pe
rmissionController/PermissionController/android_common/lint/home
SDK_ANNOTATIONS=./out/lint/annotations.zip
LINT_OPTS=-DLINT_API_DATABASE=./out/lint/api_versions.xml
./tools/out/bin/lint --quiet --project ./out/project.xml --config
./out/lint.xml --html ./out/lint-report.html --text
./out/lint-report.txt --xml ./out/lint-report.xml --compile-sdk-version
T --java-language-level 1.9 --kotlin-language-level 1.3 --url
.=.,out/soong=out --exitcode
```

This means that you can `cd` to the sandbox directory and rerun the
given command to repeat just the failing lint invocation, adding some
debugging flags and attaching with a debugger as necessary.

You can also convert this to a runconfig in IntelliJ for running the
lint Main class with the right pwd, environment variables and arguments
inside the IDE.

### New Check Fails

The platform obviously isn't a real Android app, and some of the checks
which apply for apps (such as flagging an import of `android.R` as
suspicious) do not apply in platform code.

If you've added a new lint check and it's finding false positives in
the platform, you may consider just adding it to the exclude list in
`build/soong/java/lint_defaults.txt`.

## Other Projects

For other projects built with Gradle, you can add a property in your
root `gradle.properties` to redirect AGP to use your custom version of
lint instead. This is described in more detail in
[](../usage/newer-lint.md.html).
