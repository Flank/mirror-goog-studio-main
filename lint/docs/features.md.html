**Lint Features**

# Features for users

* Around 400 built-in checks and growing regularly

* Built-in mechanism for libraries to provide their own additional
  checks enforcing correct usage of the library. For example, the
  AndroidX libraries are currently providing ~30 issues, and other open
  source libraries like the Timber logging library also provide their
  own checks.

* Integration with IDEs like Android Studio and IntelliJ

* Integration with build systems like Gradle (as well as a command line
  tool which can be used to run lint from scripts and other build
  systems; this is for example used to run lint inside Google with its
  own build system.)

* Support for “baselines”: this allows you to record all the current
  issues found in a codebase, check that in, and then any subsequent
  runs of lint will only report newly introduced issues, not the ones
  already marked in the baseline. This makes it easy to introduce lint
  into existing codebases and enforce no regressions without having to
  clean everything up right away.

* Support for suppressing incidents many other ways:
  - Using `@Suppress` (Kotlin) or `@SuppressWarnings` (Java)
  - Using `//noinspection` comment markers (already used by IntelliJ)
  - Using `tools:ignore` attributes in XML files
  - Using `lint.xml` files to record specific incidents to ignore,
    or matched by globs on paths or regular expressions on messages
    or locations

* Many other configuration options. For example, via `lint.xml` files,
  or Gradle DSL methods, or command line flags, you can change the
  severity of any issue, to for example turn a warning into an error or
  vice versa. The `lint.xml` files can be nested, and the closest
  configuration is used.

* In the Android Gradle integration, support for running a subset of
  the checks automatically in release builds, not just when the lint
  targets are invoked (the `lintVital` target, which `assembleRelease`
  depends on). This helps solve the problem where static analysis tools
  are available but unaware users aren't running them. (This is
  reserved for only the most critical issues, which in lint's parlance
  is known as “fatal” severity. Thanks to the above configurability,
  you can promote your own issues to fatal or demote some of the
  built-in ones.

* Support for quickfixes. Many lint checks have associated quickfixes,
  which can be invoked in the IDE, or (for fixes marked as safe and
  unambiguous) via a Gradle target (`lintFix`) to apply them all Kotlin
  batch.

* Support for many report output formats, including SARIF (recently
  supported by GitHub for unified static analysis tool visualization.)

# Features for lint-check authors

* Ability to easily target both Java and Kotlin source files without
  writing the checks twice, using UAST.

* Powerful AST APIs for analyzing source code: UAST and PSI for Java
  and Kotlin, ASM for bytecode, DOM for XML.

* Support not just for Kotlin and Java, but a number of other file
  types:
  - XML files
  - Property files
  - bytecode / `.class` files
  - Gradle files (`.gradle` and `.gradle.kts`)
  - Icon files (`.png`, `.webp`, `.gif`, etc)
  - Kotlin and Java
  - ProGuard/R8 files
  - Other (a callback which lets a lint check visit all files; for
    example, lint's `PrivateKeyDetector` looks at files to see if it
    looks like somebody has accidentally included a private key ASCII
    file.)

* Importantly, a lint check can check more than one of these, so for
  example, in Android, it can see which icon is designated as the
  application icon in the XML manifest file, and then it can check the
  bitmap in the icon to make sure it conforms with the styleguide for
  application icons (size guidelines, transparency, etc).

* Generic support for visiting abstract syntax trees with a visitor,
  but a number of convenience implementations to make common operations
  much easier. For example, you can get callbacks when
  - A method of a given name is called
  - An object of a given type is instantiated
  - A subclass of a given class or interface is implemented
  - A method annotated with a specific annotation is called (or
    more generally, an element associated with an annotated package,
    class, method, parameter or variable, is referenced.)

* A number of built-in helpers to make analysis easier, such as

  - A constant evaluator, such that if you evaluate the AST node for `3
    > 4 && 5 < 7> is returns `false`, including references to static
    final constants in the code or class files.

  - A code evaluator which can check whether one class extends another
    or implements an interface, or computing the parameter to argument
    mapping (which in Kotlin with named and default parameters and
    extension methods is not as trivial as lining up the parameters and
    arguments the way it can be done for Java)

  - A data flow analyzer which performs some simple data flow analysis
    within a method. This is used by a number of built-in checks, for
    example ensure that when you create a transaction, you also call
    `commit` on it.

* Support for implementing quickfixes. A number of lint fix
  implementations making it easy to perform text edits, perform source
  formatting or import cleanup afterwards, providing composite or
  alternatives, etc.)

* Support for a pseudo-markdown syntax in error messages, which allows
  you to use emphasis or code fonts to reference symbols etc, which
  makes the presentation in the IDE (in tooltips) or in HTML reports
  look better.

* Strong unit testing infrastructure, making it easy to write unit
  tests for lint checks and catching common errors (by running the unit
  tests repeatedly under different conditions for example). There are
  also around a dozen lint checks which looks at implementations of
  lint checks and flags potential issues. This is implemented by the
  LintDetectorDetector :-)

* Through the analysis scopes mechanism, support for writing lint
  checks that run on the fly in the editor in the IDE.

* For Android checks, a number of important abstractions such as access
  to the merged manifest, random access lookup of Android resources,
  etc.
