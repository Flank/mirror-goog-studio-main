This directory contains proto files copied from the Android Emulator code base.
The master copies of these files are located at
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/qemu/+/refs/heads/emu-master-dev/android/android-grpc/.
To update the Emulator proto files run update_protos.sh, which extracts the proto files from an Emulator
build artifact.
