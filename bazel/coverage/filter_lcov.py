"""Filters LCOV tracefiles

- Arguments are filepath prefixes to keep (or drop if prefixed with '-')
    - A path is kept if it matches at least one include and no excludes
    - If no includes are specified then everything not excluded is included
- Input tracefile comes from stdin
- Output tracefiles goes to stdout
