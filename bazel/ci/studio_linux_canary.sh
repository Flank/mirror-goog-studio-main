# Build everything, except the final studio artifacts. Building everything
# under //tools/... matches what studio_win_canary builds, and makes sure
# canary builds will have something to build in most cases (not constantly
# getting cached hits). We exclude studio artifacts because they rely on
# the --embed_label value in the non-canary build. This reduces the
# effectiveness of building and caching the studio artifacts. Since the
# final artifacts are quite large (1GB), are generated for all platforms
# (linux, windows, mac, mac_arm), and the cache cannot be shared, we exclude
# them.
