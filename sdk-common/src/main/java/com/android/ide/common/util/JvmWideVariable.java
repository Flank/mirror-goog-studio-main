/**
 * A proxy object that can access a JVM-wide variable. A JVM-wide variable is a variable that can be
 * accessible from everywhere in the JVM, even when the JVM contains classes that are loaded
 * multiple times by different class loaders. It is required that the type (class) of a JVM-wide
 * variable be loaded by a single class loader.
 *
 * <p>This class addresses the limitation of static variables in the presence of multiple class
 * loaders. It is not uncommon to assume that a static variable is unique and a public static
 * variable is accessible across the JVM. This assumption is correct as long as the defining class
 * of the static variable is loaded by only one class loader. If the defining class is loaded
 * multiple times by different class loaders, the JVM considers them as different classes, and this
 * assumption will break (i.e., the JVM might contain multiple instances of supposedly the same
 * static variable).
 *
 * <p>JVM-wide variables, on the other hand, allow a class loaded by different class loaders to
 * still reference the same variable. That is, changes to a JVM-wide variable made from a class
 * loaded by one class loader can be seen from the same class loaded by a different class loader.
 *
 * <p>A {@link JvmWideVariable} instance should typically be assigned to some static field of a
 * class, not to an instance field or a local variable within a method, since the actual JVM-wide
 * variable will not automatically be garbage-collected when it is no longer used, as one would have
 * expected from an instance field or a local variable.
 *
 * <p>The usage of this class is as follows. Suppose we previously used a static variable:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public final class Counter {
 *   public static final AtomicInteger COUNT = new AtomicInteger(0);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>We can then convert the static variable into a JVM-wide variable:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public final class Counter {
 *    public static final JvmWideVariable<AtomicInteger> COUNT =
 *      new JvmWideVariable<>(
 *        "my.package.Counter", "COUNT", AtomicInteger.class, new AtomicInteger(0));
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note that in the above example, {@code Counter.COUNT} is still a static variable of {@code
 * Counter}, with the previously discussed limitation (not only the {@code Counter} class but even
 * the {@code JvmWideVariable} class itself might be loaded multiple times by different class
 * loaders). What has changed is that {@code Counter.COUNT} is now able to access a JVM-wide
 * variable of type {@code AtomicInteger}. (The type of the JVM-variable after the conversion is the
 * same as the type of the static variable before the conversion.)
 *
 * <p>Where the context is clear, it might be easier to refer to variables of type {@code
 * JvmWideVariable} as JVM-wide variables, although strictly speaking they are not, but through them
 * we can access JVM-wide variables.
 *
 * <p>Also note that the type of a JVM-wide variable must be loaded by a single class loader. In the
 * above example, {@code Counter.COUNT} can access a JVM-wide variable as its type, {@code
 * AtomicInteger}, belongs to Java’s core classes and should never be loaded by a custom class
 * loader. If a JVM-wide variable’s type is loaded multiple times by different class loaders, it
 * might introduce some runtime casting exception as they are essentially different types.
 * (Therefore, using {@code JvmWideVariable} is probably not yet a complete solution to the
 * singleton design pattern being broken in the presence of multiple class loaders.)
 *
 * <p>Since a JVM-wide variable is by definition a shared variable, the client of this class needs
 * to provide proper synchronization when accessing a JVM-wide variable outside of this class, for
 * example by using thread-safe types such as {@link java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger} and
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap}, using (implicit or explicit) locks where the locks
 * need to work across class loaders, or using the {@link #executeCallableSynchronously(Callable)}
 * method and the like provided by this class.
 *
 * <p>For example, suppose we have a static variable of a non-thread-safe type (e.g., {@link
 * Integer}) and we use a synchronized block when modifying the variable:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public final class Counter {
 *   public static Integer COUNT = 0;
 *   public static synchronized void increaseCounter() {
 *     COUNT++;
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Then, the converted JVM-wide implementation can be as follows:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public final class Counter {
 *   public static final JvmWideVariable<Integer> COUNT =
 *       new JvmWideVariable<>("my.package.Counter", "COUNT", Integer.class, 0);
 *     public static void increaseCounter() {
 *       COUNT.executeRunnableSynchronously(() -> {
 *         COUNT.set(COUNT.get() + 1);
 *       });
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>At the end of a build, JVM-wide variables usually need to be released (by un-registering the
 * variables from the JVM via {@link #unregister()} or {@link #unregisterAll()}, and also un-linking
 * all references to them) since every build should be independent and the user may also change the
 * plugin version in between builds.
 *
 * <p>This class is thread-safe.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the JVM-wide variable. Must be loaded by a single class loader.
