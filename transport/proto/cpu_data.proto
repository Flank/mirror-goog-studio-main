// CPU usage data of an app process and the entire system at a given point.

// CPU usage data is most valuable when app data is combined with system data,
// e.g., showing the CPU usage percentage number. One data consumer (e.g., an
// Android Studio instance) would request an app's data, and another consumer
// (e.g., another Android Studio instance) would request another app's. Both of
// them need system data. Therefore, we put system data together with every
// piece of app specific data.

// The absolute values of fields in this message are not very interesting.
// The difference of two instances is more useful. It can show the system-
// wide CPU utilization percentage and an app's CPU utilization percentage.
// The values of the fields may overflow their type, but the usefulness stays
// the same.
