A simple project created for demonstration purposes. It consists of an app, inspector agent, and a library to showcase all of the parts that goes into a working inspector.

The library is a simple Key-Value store. The inspector not only allows users to see the live values of stores used by the app, but also update them and see them reflected in the app.
