<!--
This is an empty baseline file, used by modules that don't have any preexisting Lint issues.

It exists, because providing a baseline is how Bazel targets opt into running Lint on their
source code, and to allow the introduction of new lint checks without having to fix every
problem before being able to land the check.

Please don't add anything here. If your change introduces a Lint warning, suppress it with
@Suppress (in Koltin) or @SuppressWarnings (in Java) and include a comment explaining why
Lint was wrong. Please also consider fixing Lint if you see false positives.
